Thanks for helping improve **awesome-learn-spanish**!

## What belongs here
- High-quality, **Spanish-learning** resources (tools, courses, guides).
- Prefer **free** or reasonably priced options, **LATAM-friendly**, mobile-usable.
- Avoid link farms, aggressive ads, or pure AI-generated content without proven value.

## How to add a resource
1. Search the repo/issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Edit `README.md` and place the link in the best section.
3. Use this format: `- **Name** â€” one clear, specific sentence about why it helps.`
4. Keep lists alphabetized within a section when reasonable.
5. Open a Pull Request with:
   - Why itâ€™s useful for learners.
   - Target level (A1â€“C2) if known.
   - Any regional focus (e.g., LATAM, Bolivia, Mexico).

## Quality bar
- Clear learning value in first 10 minutes.
- Minimal dark patterns, reasonable privacy.
- Reliable availability (not obviously abandoned/404).
- If paid: price transparency and meaningful free preview.

## Labels we use
- `good first issue` â€” friendly starter fixes.
- `needs-discussion` â€” categorization or style questions.
- `region-bolivia`, `region-latam`, `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`.

## Linting & Link checks
We run **awesome-lint** in CI. Keep descriptions concise (â‰¤ 1 sentence) and avoid emojis in the list items.

Thanks again! ðŸ™Œ
